1. The Facebook login page opens in a new window. In order for our selenium code to work on the new window, we have to switch to the window in front.

In Selenium, each window has a identification handle, we can get all the window handles with:

driver.window_handles
The above line of code returns a list of all the window handles. The first window is at position 0 e.g.

base_window = driver.window_handles[0]
New windows that have popped out from the base_window are further down in the sequence e.g.

fb_login_window = driver.window_handles[1]
We can switch our Selenium to target the new facebook login window by:

driver.switch_to.window(fb_login_window)
You can print the driver.title to verify that it's the facebook login window that is currently target:

print(driver.title)
The full code to switch to the new pop-up window is thus:

base_window = driver.window_handles[0]
fb_login_window = driver.window_handles[1]
driver.switch_to.window(fb_login_window)
print(driver.title)
